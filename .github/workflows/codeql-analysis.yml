# ⚠️ IMPORTANT: CodeQL Default Setup Must Be Disabled
#
# This is an ADVANCED CodeQL configuration. If you see this error:
#   "CodeQL analyses from advanced configurations cannot be processed 
#    when the default setup is enabled"
#
# ACTION REQUIRED:
# A repository administrator must disable GitHub's default CodeQL setup:
# 1. Go to: Settings → Code security and analysis
# 2. Find: CodeQL analysis section
# 3. Disable the default setup
#
# See .github/CODEQL_SETUP.md for detailed instructions.
#
# GitHub's default setup and advanced workflows cannot coexist.
# This repository requires the advanced setup for custom configurations.
