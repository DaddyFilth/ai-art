# CodeQL Security Analysis Workflow
# 
# IMPORTANT: This is an ADVANCED configuration that requires GitHub's default CodeQL setup to be DISABLED.
# To disable default setup:
#   1. Go to repository Settings
#   2. Navigate to: Code security and analysis
#   3. Find "CodeQL analysis" section
#   4. Click "Disable" on the default setup
#
# If you see error "CodeQL analyses from advanced configurations cannot be processed when the default setup is enabled",
# it means default setup is still enabled and must be disabled first.
